### Notes
I also added components to reflect the average rating and vote count for each movie, which involves three labels, formatting the rating score to one decimal place and three-tiered conditional coloring (red: <5.0, organge: >5.0 & <8.0, green: >8.0). 

I spent a couple hours experimenting with adding an animated circular progress bar to provide visual for the rating. I was able to add it to each movie cell, but stuck at how to clear out the previous animation in recycled cells.
